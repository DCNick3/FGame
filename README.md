## Overview
This is a RPG game project called FGame. It's not finished yet. Now it develops by one user - DCNick3. I'm working on engine, and only thinking about story

## Download and installation
If you really want to try it, you should download project, install visual studio (minimum version is 2010), install XNA Game Studio 4.0 and it's plugins to VS. Then you can build it and enjoy.
